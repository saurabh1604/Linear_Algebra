[["index.html", "VisuaLin 1 Introduction 1.1 Chapter 1", " VisuaLin Saurabh 1 Introduction Welcome to my book! 1.1 Chapter 1 Understanding the Transformation In linear algebra, we often visualize linear transformations as the process of transforming one vector (input) into another vector (output) through a matrix.However, VisuaLin provides a unique perspective. Here, we visualize the transformation not just as a change in the output vector but as a dynamic shift in the entire input space. The entire space undergoes a transformation, resulting in the displacement of the input vector from its original position.
